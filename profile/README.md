Hey there! This is the original organization for HERON Mk I, the first CubeSat designed by the University of Toronto Aerospace Team, and the origin of the Space Systems division. We've decommissioned this organization, and all of the repos have been transferred to [the unified `utat-ss` org](https://github.com/utat-ss). You'll find the code there, as well as what we're working on now. See you there!
